The [C]openh[A]gen Center for Health Technology [R]esearch [P]latform (CARP) enables researchers to run mobile health (mHealth) studies where data is collected on participant's smartphones and wearable devices. Data is securely uploaded and managed in a hosting infrastructure managed by the Technical University of Denmark.
CARP is a platform for running research studies in the health domain â€“ also known as Digital Phenotyping. Such studies range from technical feasibility studies of novel technology to large-scale clinical studies. The platform is very versatile both in terms of support for different types of health domains, as well as in terms of technical support and configuration.
CARP Webservices API primarily provides the REST API (Spring/Kotlin) consumed by clients for the CARP project.
The architecture is a modular monolith, with loosely coupled services and endpoints separated by feature-type (i.e auth, data points, study, protocols, deployments, documents, collections, consent documents, file). Shared services can be found under the common directory, and are again separated in directories by type (rather than controllers, models, views, services, factories, presenters, etc). Overall, the CARP Webservice API architecture is divided into three layers; API Gateway, Security, Services, and Persistence layer.
