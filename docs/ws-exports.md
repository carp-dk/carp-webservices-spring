# Export Section

The Export section of the project provides tools and functionalities for generating anonymous accounts and exporting data.

## 1. Anonymous Account Generation

**Purpose**: The Anonymous Account Generation feature allows the researchers/researcher assistants to create anonymous accounts that can be used in studies.

- **Functionality**:
    - **Account Creation**: Generates accounts without personal identifiers, ensuring that users can participate anonymously.
    - **Unique Identifiers**: Each anonymous account is assigned a universally unique identifier (UUID) to distinguish between accounts without revealing personal information.
    - **Usage Context**: Primarily used in research studies, trials, or any situation where user anonymity must be maintained.

- **Privacy Considerations**: This feature ensures compliance with data protection regulations by avoiding the storage or processing of personally identifiable information (PII) within these accounts.

## 2. Study Data Export

**Purpose**: The Study Data Export feature facilitates the secure extraction of study-related data. This can include participant responses, study results, and other relevant data points.

- **Functionality**:
    - **Data Selection**: Allows users to select specific datasets or the entire study data for export.
    - **Export Formats**: A zip file containing JSON for data, with TXT for system logs, and other files in study resources.
    - **Batch Export**: Supports exporting data in bulk for large studies or trials.

- **Security Measures**:
    - **Access Controls**: Researchers and researcher assistants only.
