## Protocol Example
The `expectedParticipantData` section of the study protocol is used to define type information for the study. Any data type utilized must be defined here.

consider a study protocol with the following Roles

```json

"participantRoles":[
    {
        "role":"Participant",
        "isOptional":false
    },
    {
        "role":"Guardian",
        "isOptional":true
    }
],
```
The `expectedParticipantData` can be set as
- when no `assignedTo` used, the data is shared and can be set by any participant
- data can be assigned to multiple roles


```json

"expectedParticipantData":[
    {
        "attribute":{
            "__type":"dk.cachet.carp.common.application.users.ParticipantAttribute.DefaultParticipantAttribute",
            "inputDataType":"dk.carp.webservices.input.address"
        }
    },
    {
        "attribute":{
            "__type":"dk.cachet.carp.common.application.users.ParticipantAttribute.DefaultParticipantAttribute",
            "inputDataType":"dk.carp.webservices.input.phone_number"
        },
        "assignedTo":{
            "__type":"dk.cachet.carp.common.application.users.AssignedTo.Roles",
            "roleNames":[
                "Participant"
            ]
        }
    },
    {
        "attribute":{
            "__type":"dk.cachet.carp.common.application.users.ParticipantAttribute.DefaultParticipantAttribute",
            "inputDataType":"dk.cachet.carp.input.sex"
        },
        "assignedTo":{
            "__type":"dk.cachet.carp.common.application.users.AssignedTo.Roles",
            "roleNames":[
                "Participant",
                "Guardian"
            ]
        }
